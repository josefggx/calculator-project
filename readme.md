# Calculator
This is a browser version of a Calculator. I started this project to practice my DOM manipulation skills and improve my JavaScript Skills. It was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## Functionality
- The following basic operations are supported: Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiple and Module.
- Comes with one button to delete a single input (backspace), and one to clear the whole display and reset de Calculator (AC).
- Keyboard inputs are supported for operators, numbers, decimal dot, backspace and delete.
- You can press Enter or = on the keyboard, or press the button with the "=" to see the result of the operation.
- When you try to divide by 0, you'll get a "What are you doing?" message on the display.

## Learning Outcome:
- I greatly improved my understanding of JavaScript, I did my best to make the calculator work exactly like I wanted, and I'm very happy with the results. But I still have to improve in clean coding.
- I improved my CSS skills, I used Flexbox for this project, I really enjoy using it and learning new things about CSS and Flexbox.
- The reusability of functions, and the handling of combined event listeners was one of the most necessary things to satisfactorily achieve the expected result.
- Although I'm not a UI designer, it was fun to design the project on my own and honestly, I really liked the end result. I used Figma for this purpose. For my next project I'll learn basic color theory to give my project a better look. 
- It was a very fun project to make, and I feel that my learning outcome for this project was important and valuable. I still have a lot to learn and this whole process excites me.
